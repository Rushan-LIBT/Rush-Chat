# 🚨 Important: Render File Upload Limitation

## ⚠️ **Critical Issue on Render Free Tier**

**Profile photos will be DELETED when your Render service restarts!**

### **Why This Happens:**
- Render's free tier uses **ephemeral storage**
- Files uploaded during runtime are stored temporarily
- When the service restarts (happens automatically), all uploaded files are lost
- Only files in your GitHub repository persist

### **Current Upload Behavior:**
1. ✅ Upload works initially
2. ✅ Photos display correctly
3. ❌ Photos disappear after service restart (~24 hours or when inactive)

## **🔧 Solutions:**

### **Option 1: Cloud Storage (Recommended)**
Replace local file upload with cloud storage:
- **Cloudinary** (Free tier: 25 credits/month)
- **AWS S3** (Free tier: 5GB)
- **Google Cloud Storage**
- **Imgur API**

### **Option 2: Base64 Storage (Quick Fix)**
Store images as Base64 in MongoDB:
- Pros: No file system needed
- Cons: Database size increases, slower performance

### **Option 3: Upgrade Render Plan**
- Render Pro plans have persistent storage
- Costs $7+/month

## **🚀 Quick Cloudinary Fix:**

1. Sign up at [cloudinary.com](https://cloudinary.com)
2. Get your credentials
3. Replace multer with Cloudinary upload
4. Images will persist permanently

## **Current Status:**
- ✅ Upload functionality is working
- ⚠️ Files will disappear on restart
- 🔧 Need cloud storage for production use

**For now, upload testing works, but don't rely on it for production!**
